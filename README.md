### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello, I'm [Nikita](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikita-masalov/) ðŸ‘‹

I've graduated from [Kood/JÃµhvi](https://kood.tech/) in March 2024. Throughout my studies at this school, I've acquired valuable skills such as programming, problem-solving, teamwork, and project building. The most important skill I've gained is a "I can do it" mindset. I firmly believe that every problem has a solution; you just need to spend some time to find it. 

I am keen on expanding and honing my skills as a React Developer, but I would also be happy to start moving towards Full Stack Developer role.

Currently I'm working on my own portfolio web site ðŸ’¼ 

My favourite  projects from my Kood/JÃµhvi journey:

[Mock Market](https://github.com/GIGI-QUEEN/mock-market) ðŸ¤‘ - a live-data stock-market app written on flutter;

[Chess App](https://github.com/GIGI-QUEEN/flutter-chess) â™Ÿ - chess app written on flutter;
